## Disclaimer

This project is for **educational and experimental purposes only**. I am **still working on implementing many tweaks**, so the tool is not yet fully functional. Each tweak included was **carefully chosen by hand**, but results may vary depending on your system. I am not responsible for any system damage or data loss caused by the scripts. Always back up your system before applying any tweaks.
